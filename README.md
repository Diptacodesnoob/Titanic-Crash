# Naive Bias for Predicting Titanic Survival

## Overview
This project applies the Naive Bayes classification algorithm to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information such as passenger class, age, gender, and ticket fare.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features like:
- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
Alternatively, you can use Jupyter Notebook to execute the provided `.ipynb` file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-naive-bayes.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd titanic-naive-bayes
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook naive-bias-for-predicting-titanic.ipynb
```
4. Run the cells to preprocess data, train the model, and analyze the results.

## Model
The Naive Bayes classifier is used due to its efficiency with categorical data. The model predicts survival probability based on given features.

## Results
The model achieves a reasonable accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of Naive Bayes in classification problems with structured data. Performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.
